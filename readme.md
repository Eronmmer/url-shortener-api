# URL Shortener API

Just messing around with Express.js

## Features

- You can shorten your URLs, but because, I don't have money yet, you can only use the service via localhost.

- Number of click count

- Details of each client click(OS, browser type, mobile or desktop). Only the admins can see this in the DB, it's never sent to the client

## Usage

- `npm install`, 
- create your .env file and add your MONGO_URI, PORT and JWT_SECRET details, 
- `npm run dev`


## Todos

- authenticated users should be able to customize their short links.

- Build a React FE to bring this API to life.

- Deploy and buy a domain name whenever I have spare cash.
